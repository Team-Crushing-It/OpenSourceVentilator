# OpenSourceVentilator
This is an electronics design for a 3D printed ventilator design made from an arduino starter kit and car parts

This repository is setup to support the open-sourced documentation and development. 

Documentation:

Background:

Team Crushing it is designing an open-source Ventilator alongside research from MIT and Spain

Originally ventilators were made with Windshield Wiper motors. During the Covid-19 crisis when ventilators were in demand,
a company in Proxify open-sourced a Ventilator design with an ambubag
https://sifted.eu/articles/coronavirus-windscreen-ventilator/

This is very similar to work being done by MIT
https://e-vent.mit.edu/

Problem with Proxify is that they have literally no electronics. The problem with MIT is they have too many electronics. Both teams have not addressed the functions of a modern day ventilator; things like alarms or simple controls. 

This project is aimed at designing the electronics to support modern ventilator controls and safety precautions. 

Thank you for supporting us in this endeavor and look forward to the design being documented every step of development
